This body of code is to allow an inexpensive Amazon EC2 server 
  to 'keep alive' a running, expensive Amazon EC2 server while the
  expensive Amazon EC2 server is being regularly used.
  The inexpensive Amazon EC2 server merely needs to have a
  URL on its web server regularly accessed in less than 120 minute intervals.
  With lack of use, the expensive Amazon EC2 Server will shut itself down
  automatically after 120 minutes.

The time is modifiable by changing 
  $SHUTDOWN_TIME_IN_MINUTES
  In the file
  resetShutDown
