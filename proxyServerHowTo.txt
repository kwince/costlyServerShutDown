This is an OUTLINE. It's assumed you know how to work with Amazon EC2 instances.

Root account names on virtual servers in clouds are often NOT 'root'.
In fact using 'root' is discouraged. On ubuntu servers, some names
seen are 'ubuntu', or 'bitnami'. 

That is why using 'crontab -e' is used instead of hand editing
the /etc/crontab file. You are editing the crontab of the
'sudo privileged account' by using crontab -e on that user's terminal .
See 'man crontab'

The file 'count',is set to 120 minutes by default.

================================================================================
MINIMIZED-RUNTIME SERVER
  On your local machine
    mkdir ./tmp
    copy all files from this project to ./tmp
  sftp into minimized-runtime server
    put ./tmp/count 
    put ./tmp/countDown
    put ./tmp/startOrResetShutDown
  exit sftp
    rm ./tmp/count 
    rm ./tmp/countDown
    rm ./tmp/startOrResetShutDown
  ssh into minimized-runtime server and do the following:
    Create the crontab line listed by using 'crontab -e'
      insert following line into bottom of the file
      "*/1 * * * * bash /home/${root_account_name}/shutdown/countDown >/dev/null 2>&1"
        (once a minute, take out quotation marks)
      <ctrl>x, accept file name
    mkdir $HOME/shutdown
  Move the files listed to their location
    $HOME/shutdown/count
    $HOME/shutdown/countDown
    $HOME/shutdown/startOrResetShutDown
  Exit from ssh session to the minimized-runtime server

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install oracle-java7-installer
  Add web server to instance
    sudo tasksel --list-tasks (to see what tasksel is all about: 'i'=installed)
    sudo tasksel install lamp-server
    sudo apt-get purge mysql* (me no like mysql)
    sudo tasksel install postgresql-server
  Update and upgrade all packages and get security updates
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade
  Set up automatic security upgrades
    https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutomaticSecurityUpdates/
      (use nano, vi, vim, or other text editors instead of the gui ones listed)
  Create directories needed
    sudo mkdir /var/www/.ec2; sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/www/.ec2
    sudo mkdir /var/www/.ssh; sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/www/.ssh
    sudo mkdir /var/www-scripts
    sudo mkdir /var/www-scripts/shutdown
  Install needed program
    sudo apt-get install unzip
  Install EC2 tools
    sudo unzip ec2-api-tools.zip
    sudo mv ec2-api-tools-x.x.x.x/* /var/www/.ec2
    sudo mv *.pem /var/www/.ec2
    sudo chmod 700 /var/www/.ec2/*.pem
    sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/.ec2
  Find java home
    which java
      (will return something like: /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle/bin/java)
      (you need up to the '/bin/java' part or: '/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle')
      (this will be $JAVA_HOME)
  Set up 'www-data' user's environment during bash sessions
    sudo nano /var/www/.bashrc
      (cut and paste following lines and edit in place)

#needed for some reason--------------------------------------------------------------
export HOME=/var/www

#for ec2/aws toolset-----------------------------------------------------------------
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle (what YOU found above)<-<-<-xxxxxxxxxxxxx
export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH

#for ec2/aws toolset-----------------------------------------------------------------
export EC2_HOME=$HOME/.ec2
export PATH=$PATH:$EC2_HOME/bin

#add ec2 tools to default path
#export PATH=$HOME/.ec2/bin:$PATH

    '<ctrl>x' to save, accept file name
    sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/www/.bashrc
  Set up apache server to avoid listing contents of wrong files,
  keep it from being outside of its document root,
  and to keep it from being in $HOME/.ssh and $HOME/.ec2 direcories
    sudo nano /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
      (cut and paste the follwoing lines at end of file)

# Prevent directory Listing of filesystem
<Directory />
  Order deny,allow
  Deny from all
</Directory>

# Allow serving EXACT file names from document root, but not listing directory contents
<Directory /var/www/*>
 Order allow,deny
  allow from all
  Options FollowSymLinks
</Directory>

# block all directories in document root that begin with .
<Directory /var/www/.*>
  Order deny,allow
  Deny from all
</Directory>

    '<ctrl>x' to save, accept file name
    sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
  Move file called by apache when you go to http://ec2-api-tools-x.x.x.x/startOrResetShutDown.php
    mv startOrResetShutDown.php /var/www
    sudo chmod 400 /var/www.startOrResetShutDown.php
  

===========================================================================
Installing the Trigger URL

For exmaple on cloudbees.com projects, or any of your own Jenkins servers,
you could put a prebuild step as bash code that executes:

  "wget http://ec2-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx.compute-1.amazonaws.com/startOrResetShutDown.php -q -O -"

Ths simply does a GET request to the URL and returns the file to stdin, vs 
storing it as a file.

What's Next:
============================================================================

1/It might be good to store the php file above in a directory named
with a GUID, so that it's nearly impossible to know this url and
have hackers access this link and cost you money or processor time.

  Example:
  mkdir /var/www/21EC2020-3AEA-1069-A2DD-08002B30309D
    mv startOrResetShutDown.php /var/www/21EC2020-3AEA-1069-A2DD-08002B30309D
    sudo chmod 400 /var/www/21EC2020-3AEA-1069-A2DD-08002B30309D/startOrResetShutDown.php

  DON'T use that one, "it's taken" ;-) (it came from wikipedia article on GUIDs)

2/ If doing this for multiple machines AND you've obfuscated the url as above, you will
   have to install multiple versions of the php in the directory, or pass the instance id
   in a variable. You COULD name the files 'startOrResetShutDwon-i-xxxxxxx.php substituting
   the instance id for i.xxxxxxxx.
   You will also have to edit the instance id in each file. 

3/ Since everything about this is on the URL address line of the requests, every relaying
server in the Internet path to your Proxy server has a record of the URL for long time,
(thank  you terrorists, conservatives in opposing religious cultures, and the US government).
This makes it a huge security hole.

So you might want to change the urls to use SSL (https) and the php script to read a POST
variable, or two of them. (one would be a UUID as a password, and the other would be
the instance_id). This modificaton is WAY beyond the scope of this document.
